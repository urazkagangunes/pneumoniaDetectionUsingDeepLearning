Pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images using deep learning (CNNs)

Pneumonia Detection using Deep Learning

This repository contains the implementation of my Master’s Thesis at Altınbaş University, focusing on the detection of pneumonia from chest X-ray images using Deep Learning techniques.

📌 Project Overview

The project aims to develop an automated system for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the system supports early diagnosis, reduces the workload of healthcare professionals, and improves decision-making accuracy.

⚙️ Technologies & Tools

Python 3.x

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

OpenCV for image processing

Scikit-learn for evaluation metrics

Jupyter Notebook for development and visualization

📂 Dataset

The dataset is a publicly available Chest X-ray dataset (Kaggle) with two categories:

Pneumonia

Normal

Note: Dataset is not included due to size limitations. Download it from Kaggle - Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)


Follow the steps in the notebook to:

Load and preprocess the dataset

Train the CNN model

Evaluate performance

Visualize results

📊 Results

The CNN model effectively distinguishes between Pneumonia and Normal X-rays.

Evaluation metrics include Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

Detailed results, visualizations, and analysis are in the notebook and the thesis report.
